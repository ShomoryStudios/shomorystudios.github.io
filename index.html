        <h3>Collaboration Criteria</h3>
        <p>This section gives an overview of the criteria we are expecting every potential collaborator to meet.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reference Past Work:</strong> Collaborators will be asked to provide references to past projects
                of their work in order to provide a rough outline of their skill and style.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Commitment to Completion:</strong> Collaborators should be able to finish projects in a timely
                manner and demonstrate a commitment to follow through and complete the project.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Handling of Feedback:</strong> Collaborators should be open to feedback and be willing to make
                desired changes to ensure the project's consistency with its purpose.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Availability:</strong> While we don't ask for constant availability, we do expect that
                collaborators can be reached and respond within reasonable timeframes.</li><br>
            <li><strong>No Studio Access:</strong> Due to security reasons, we currently do not allow studio access and
                kindly ask every collaborator to send their projects in their respective file format.</li>
        </ul>
        <br><hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #575966;">
        <h3>Compensation Models</h3>
        <p>This section gives an overview of the various types of collaborations we are currently open to.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>One-Time Payment:</strong> A single, non-recurring payment to the collaborator that depends on
                the size of the project. Usually, the collaborator will be a sum up front and receive the remaining
                compensation after satisfactory completion of the project.</li>
            <ul>
                <li class="sub-item"><strong>Bonus after Success:</strong> Should the game be deemed successful enough
                    by our assessment, an additional bonus will be rewarded.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <br><hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #575966;">
        <br>
        <p>We currently do not offer any form of royalty payouts at the moment, as we are a very new game studio and
            have yet to fully establish the foundation for our endeavors. As we progress, we will consider opportunities
            for this type of compensation in the future.</p>
